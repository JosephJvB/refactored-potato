### Block Dupe messages:
- Redis: failed
    - there's a whole VPC thing to redis which makes it really hard to use.
    - Redis needs vpc
    - Lambda needs to be in vpc for it to work
    - Putting both in vpc meant actions to s3 failed? I dunno.


- DynamoDB: success...?
    - bad use case, not threadsafe
    - If I really wanted to avoid duplicate messages, use FIFO Queue bro
    - Even with a threadsafe redis lock or whatever, the "block" is only in place as long as the function is running. If a message is duplicated after the function has run, it will avoid the block. I don't think it would happen - but man it's another black mark haha.
